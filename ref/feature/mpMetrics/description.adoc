Microprofile Metrics provides a `/metrics` endpoint from which you can access all metrics emitted by the Open Liberty server and deployed applications.
When the application is running, you can view your metrics from any browser by visiting the endpoint. The endpoint can be accessed through the metrics API that enables security configuration.
