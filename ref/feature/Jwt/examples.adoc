To obtain JSON Web Token (JWT) tokens from the JWT token generation endpoint in the jwt-1.0 feature

-Authenticate with your credentials to access the JWT token generation endpoint at the following URL:
`https://<host>:<port>/jwt/ibm/api/<configId>/token

After authentication succeeds, the MP-JWT format token is returned in JSON form. The token contains the user and groups for the user as recorded in the user registry of the server.
-Use the <configId> ID to refer to a corresponding JWTBuilder entry in the server.xml file. Specify token attributes, such as issuer and expiration time, in the JWTBuilder entry.
- If you do not define JWTBuilder elements in the server.xml file, use the defaultJWT element as the <configId> ID.
- To find the available JWT builder configuration attributes at jwtBuilder - JWT Builder (jwtBuilder). https://www.openliberty.io/docs/ref/config/#jwtBuilder.html
