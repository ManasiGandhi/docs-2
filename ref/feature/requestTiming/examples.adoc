== Examples

=== Slow and hung request threshold configuration
The slow and hung request thresholds are configured by setting the `slowRequestThreshold` and `hungRequestThreshold` attributes within the `<requestTiming/>` element configuration in the `server.xml` file. Setting these attributes specifies a single slow and hung request threshold for all requests that are timed. You can also set different slow and hung request thresholds for different types of requests. An embedded `<servletTiming/>` or `<jdbcTiming/>` element configuration in the server.xml file overrides the configured slow and hung request thresholds that are defined in the `<requestTiming/>` element. A `<servletTiming/>` element configuration can set the slow and hung request threshold by application name, servlet name, or both. A `<jdbcTiming/>` element configuration can set the slow and hung request threshold by datasource name, sql string, or both. In both cases, the names are taken from the context information for the request, as reported by the https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/feature/#eventLogging-1.0.html[Event Logging feature]. The following example shows the `<requestTiming/>` element configuration with the embedded `<jdbcTiming/>` element configuration:
[source,xml]
----
<requestTiming slowRequestThreshold="10s" hungRequestThreshold="10m">
  <jdbcTiming dataSourceName="testDBSource" slowRequestThreshold="500ms" hungRequestThreshold="5m"/>
</requestTiming>
----
The `<requestTiming/>` element configuration can also include the embedded `<servletTiming/>` element configuration for one specific servlet and one specific web application as shown in the following example:
[source,xml]
----
<requestTiming slowRequestThreshold="10s" hungRequestThreshold="10m">
  <servletTiming servletName="Arm10Servlet" hungRequestThreshold=”20s”/>
  <servletTiming appName="SecurityExchangeApp” hungRequestThreshold=”2h”/>
</requestTiming>
----

The event log contains the type and context information for each request that was processed by the server. With type and context information, you can create a `<servletTiming/>` or `<jdbcTiming/>` element configuration in the `server.xml` file for the requests that require different threshold values. A `<servletTiming/>` or `<jdbcTiming/>` element configuration can be used only to time a root level request. For example, if a servlet request makes a JDBC query, the JDBC query cannot be timed because the servlet request is the root level request.

=== Slow request detection
When a request runs for longer than it was configured, a warning message is written in the messages log file. Details about the request and events that composed the request are captured. The following example shows the log message for a request that crossed the slow request threshold. The default is 10 seconds:

----

The request continues to be monitored, and a further warning is logged if the request is running beyond another 10 seconds. The following example shows the format for the log messages:

----
TRAS0112W: Request <(Request ID)> has been running on thread <THREADID> for at least <DURATION>. The following stack trace shows what this thread is currently running.
<STACK TRACE>
<DURATION AND OPERATIONS Table>
----
In the example, the `<(Request ID)>` element is the same ID that can be used to search for log and trace messages that correspond to the request. If you use binary logging, you can search for log and trace entries with the same `requestID` extension by using the binary log command.
The `<STACK TRACE>` element indicates the method that is running. After the stack trace, the `<DURATION AND OPERATIONS Table>` element specifies the tabular format of the request that shows the duration and operation, which is also referred to as an event. The `Duration` column indicates the time that is taken by the corresponding operation of the request. The plus sign (+) indicates events within the request that are still running. The next line shows the duration without +, which indicates that the corresponding operation completed in the specified duration. The operation shows the `EVENT TYPE` and `CONTEXT INFO` elements for that operation.

=== Hung request detection
If the request exceeds the default `hungRequestThreshold` value or the configured threshold value, a warning message is written in the messages log file along with the details about the request. Details about the request and events that compose the request are captured. For a hung request detection, a series of three thread dumps, also known as java cores, is taken with a 1-minute delay between each dump. The following log message example shows the log messages for a request that crossed the hung request detection threshold. The default duration value is 10 minutes. The value that is configured in the following example is 4 min:

----
[WARNING ] TRAS0114W: Request AAA7WlpP7l7_AAAAAAAAAAA was running on thread 00000021 for at least 240001.015ms. The following table shows the events that have run during this request.
Duration       Operation

     0.095ms       websphere.session.setAttribute | mCzBMyzMvAEnjMJJx9zQYIw | userID
     0.007ms       websphere.session.setAttribute | mCzBMyzMvAEnjMJJx9zQYIw | visitCount

If a request gets completed after it was detected as hanging initially, a message similar to the following example is logged:

----
TRAS0115W: Request AAA7WlpP7l7_AAAAAAAAAAA
----
When a request is detected to be hanging, a series of three thread dumps is initiated. After the completion of the three thread dumps, further thread dumps are created only if the new requests are detected to be hanging.

If the `interruptHungRequests` value is set to true in the request timing configuration, an attempt is made to interrupt the hung request after the first thread dump is completed. When the server is using an IBM JRE, the classes in the `com.ibm.jvm package`, such as `InterruptibleIOContext` and `InterruptibleLockContext`, are used to interrupt the request. Other methods might be used to interrupt the request that depend on what features are configured in the server, and what code the application is executing when the hung request is detected. In most cases, the result of an interrupt is a declared exception that is thrown to the application code that was in control when the hung request was detected. The application can then handle the exception and return an appropriate error to the caller. If multiple hung requests are detected concurrently, each request waits until the first thread dump for the first hung request to complete before attempting to interrupt that request.

=== Request Timing feature restrictions
When enabled, the Request Timing feature has been shown to have a 4% adverse effect on the maximum possible application throughput when measured with the DayTrader application. While the effect on your application might be more or less than that percentage, be aware that some performance degradation might be noticeable.
