= Package and deploy applications with Open Liberty

You can choose among different options for packaging, containerizing, and deploying applications with Open Liberty.
However, the simplest workflow for developing your cloud-native applications is to build applications with Maven or Gradle, containerize server packages with Docker, and deploy to the cloud with Kubernetes or OpenShift.

== Package
Before you containerize and deploy your application, package it with the Open Liberty runtime.
There are different tools that you can use to package your application.
Using Maven or Gradle to build and package your application is one of the easiest ways to get your application ready for cloud deployment.
Maven and Gradle both work well as part of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
They start with the Open Liberty kernel and download specific feature versions that are listed as dependencies.

=== Maven
link:https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] is a build automation tool that makes managing your builds and dependencies easier.
With Maven, you use a Project Object Model (POM) file written in XML to define information about your project, and Maven downloads and installs all dependencies for you.
The link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven[Open Liberty Maven plug-in] helps manage your Open Liberty server and applications.

After you enable the Maven plug-in, specify `war` in the `<packaging>` element in your `pom.xml` file.
Then, run the `mvn package` command to package your application and Open Liberty into a WAR file.
This command compiles, verifies, and builds the project.
After you create this server package, you're ready to containerize and deploy it.
To learn more about the Open Liberty Maven plug-in, check out this guide on link:/guides/maven-intro.html[Building a web application with Maven].

=== Gradle
Like Maven, link:https://gradle.org/[Gradle] is a build tool that provides dependency management for your projects.
However, Gradle has it's own domain-specific language (DSL) that's based on Groovy.
Similar to the Maven plug-in, the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle[Open Liberty Gradle plug-in] provides tasks for you to manage your server and applications.

After you install the Gradle plug-in, include the following lines of code at the top of your `build.gradle` file to specify required plug-ins:
----
apply plugin: 'war'
apply plugin: 'liberty'
----
Then, run the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/master/docs/libertyPackage.md#libertypackage-task[`libertyPackage` task] to package your application and Open Liberty into a WAR file.
Once you create this server package, you can containerize and deploy it.
To learn more about the Open Liberty Gradle plug-in, check out this guide on link:https://openliberty.io/guides/gradle-intro.html[Building a web application with Gradle].

=== Runnable JAR file
You can also use Maven or Gradle to package your application with Open Liberty into a runnable JAR file that contains the application and server runtime.
The JAR file is portable and ready to deploy both the application and server together.
Packaging locally can be useful for debugging and testing during development.

With Maven, run the following goal that overrides the `include` option to specify a minimum runnable JAR file as the packaging type:
----
mvn liberty:package -Dinclude=minify,runnable
----

With Gradle, include the following `packageLiberty` block in the `libertyPackage` task to specify a minimum runnable JAR file as the packaging type:
----
packageLiberty {
    packageName = "MyPackage"
    include = "minify,runnable"
}
----

Each example overrides the `include` property to package your application and runtime into a runnable JAR file.
The `minify` option specifies that the runnable JAR file contains only what you need to run your application so the application is as lightweight as possible.

== Containerize
After you create a server package by packaging your application with the Open Liberty runtime, you can containerize it for deployment.
Containerizing your server package bundles together the environment that your application needs to run.
With Docker containers, you have the portability to run your application on any machine that is running Docker.

A Docker image is a multi-layered file that serves as a template for a Docker container.
The simplest way to containerize your server package is by using the latest link:https://hub.docker.com/_/open-liberty[Open Liberty Docker images], which include the most recent feature versions and link:/docs/ref/general/#security-vulnerabilities.html[security fixes].
If you want to build your own Docker image, you need to create a Dockerfile.
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains commands about how an image is built.
If you choose to create your own Docker image, make sure to follow link:/docs/ref/general/#server-configuration-hardening.html[server configuration hardening best practices].

Once you have a Dockerfile, you can run the `docker build` command to build an image for the container.
Finally, the `docker run` command runs your container that houses the application.

To learn more about running applications with Open Liberty Docker images, see these guides on link:https://openliberty.io/guides/docker.html[Using Docker containers to develop microservices] and link:/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices].

== Deploy
After you containerize your server package, you can deploy it to link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] or link:https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift].
Kubernetes is an orchestration and automation platform that is used for managing and scaling containers.
For a step-by-step introduction to Kubernetes, check out the link:https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes guide].
OpenShift is a project that is built on Kubernetes and adds functionality to meet enterprise needs.
For a step-by-step introduction to OpenShift, check out the link:https://openliberty.io/guides/cloud-openshift.html[Deploying microservices to OpenShift guide].

There are different cloud solutions that can run your Kubernetes or OpenShift workloads, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, IBM Cloud, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Go to the link:https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=deploy[Open Liberty deployment guides] to learn the specifics of deploying to each of these services.
A cloud-based infrastructure enables you to focus on development without getting hung-up in deployment infrastructure issues.
