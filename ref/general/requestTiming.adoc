= Slow and hung request detection

When an application takes longer than expected to complete a request, the request can be logged as slow or hung.
Your applications need a continuous monitoring tool to detect and analyze slow and hung requests.
The link:https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/feature/#requestTiming-1.0.html[Request Timing] feature automatically detects slow and hung requests and logs the information when the request is completed.

The feature assigns a slow or hung request a request ID that is logged along with the completion time and other information about the request.
If a previously hung request is completed, a detailed message is logged, including the ID and time of completion of the request.

== Configure slow and hung request detection

You can enable the Request Timing feature by adding `requestTiming-1.0` to the list of features in the `server.xml` file.

[source,java]
----
<featureManager>
      ...
      <feature>requestTiming-1.0</feature>
      ...
</featureManager>
----

The slow and hung request thresholds are configured by setting the `slowRequestThreshold` and `hungRequestThreshold` attributes on the `requestTiming` element in your `server.xml` file.
These attributes specify global slow and hung request thresholds for all requests that are timed.
For more details about default and configured thresholds in the Request Timing feature, see link:https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/docs/ref/config/#requestTiming.html.

== Detect slow requests

When a request runs for longer than the `slowRequestThreshold`, the Request Timing feature generates a warning message in the messages log file.
The message includes details about the request and events that made up the request.
The default threshold value is 10 seconds.

The following example shows the format of a log messages.

[source,java]
----
TRAS0112W: Request <(Request ID)> has been running on thread <THREADID> for at least <DURATION>. The following stack trace shows that this thread is currently running.
<STACK TRACE>
<DURATION AND OPERATIONS Table>
----

The message helps you analyze the reason behind the slow request, though it is difficult to determine whether the request is hung at that point or is still running slowly.
To address this issue, three messages are displayed for any slow request at the interval specified by the `<slowRequestThreshold>` attribute.
The stack trace data gives the information about the method that is running, while the request data gives details about the request, like the request ID and duration.
The three different stack trace and request data help you better understand where the request is going wrong by looking into what the thread is running currently.

No further warnings are logged about the request unless the duration of the request crosses the hung request detection threshold.

== Detect hung requests

If the request exceeds the `hungRequestThreshold`, a warning message is generated in the messages log file with the details about the request and events that made up the request.
A series of three Java cores is taken with a 1-minute delay between them.
Further Java cores are created only if the new requests are detected to be hanging.

The following log message sample shows the log messages for a request that crossed the hung request detection threshold.
The default duration value is 10 min.
The value that is configured in the following example is 4 min.

[source,java]
----
[WARNING ] TRAS0114W: Request AAA7WlpP7l7_AAAAAAAAAAA was running on thread 00000021 for at least 240001.015ms. The following table shows the events that have run during this request.
