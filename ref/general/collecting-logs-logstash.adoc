= Collecting logs and events with Logstash collector

Configure link:/docs/ref/feature/#logstashCollector-1.0.html[the Logstash collector feature] to collect logs and other events from your Open Liberty servers and send them to a remote Logstash server. The collected events can be used for log analysis and troubleshooting purposes by products such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.

== About this task

Logstash is an open-source log management tool that can prepare log data for analysis by products such as Elasticsearch, Kibana, Kafka, and RabbitMQ, as well as for custom analysis solutions. You can use the Open Liberty Logstash collector feature to send your log data to a Logstash server. Although this feature can send log data for analysis by any of the available output plug-ins from Logstash, many users choose to use Logstash with Elasticsearch and Kibana. Together, these three tools comprise the Elastic stack, a widely used open-source platform to collect, manage, and build dashboards for log data. For more information, see link:https://www.elastic.co/downloads/[the Elastic website].

The `logstashCollector-1.0` feature was tested with the following products:

- Logstash V5.3.x, Elasticsearch V5.3.x, and Kibana V5.3.x
- Logstash V6.4.x, Elasticsearch V6.4.x, and Kibana V6.4.x
- Logstash V7.x, Elasticsearch V7.x, and Kibana V7.x


== Procedure

Use the following steps to collect your Open Liberty log data with the Logstash collector feature, send it to a Logstash server, and view it in a Kibana dashboard.

. Set up Logstash by following link:https://www.elastic.co/logstash[the instructions from Elastic].

. Create or acquire certificate and key pair files for SSL for Logstash. +
The following example command for OpenSSL generates a certificate and key pair. Customize the number of days that the keys are valid as needed.
+
[role,command]
----
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout logstash.key -out logstash.crt -days 365 -nodes
----

. For Logstash and Elasticsearch users, download a sample Logstash configuration file and an index template file from link:https://github.com/WASdev/sample.logstash.collector[Sample Logstash Collector dashboards for Liberty].

.. Download the `liberty_logstash.conf` Logstash configuration file and the `liberty_logstash_template.json` index template file from the directory that corresponds to your Elastic version.

.. In the `liberty_logstash.conf` file, customize the lumberjack `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_key` paths and the `Elasticsearch_host_name:port_number` Elasticsearch hosts value.

. Complete the following steps for each Open Liberty server from which you want to collect events:

.. Acquire or create a keystore for the Open Liberty server. To create a self-signed certificate, use the following command. Customize the server name, password, and subject as needed.
+
[role,command]
----
d:\wlp\bin\securityUtility createSSLCertificate --server=myServerName --password="Liberty" --subject=CN=myHostname,OU=defaultServer,O=ibm,C=us
----

.. Import the `logstash.crt` file that you created in step 2 into the `trust.jks` file in your server. Customize the `wlp_install_dir` directory and server name as needed. When prompted for a password, use the certificate password that you specified in step 4a.
+
[role,command]
----
d:\java\bin\keytool -import -noprompt -alias logstash -file logstash.crt -keystore wlp_install_dir\usr\servers\myServerName\resources\security\trust.jks -storepass Liberty
----

.. Run the following command to install the logstashcollector-1.0 feature:
+
[role,command]
----
d:\wlp\bin\installUtility install logstashcollector-1.0
----

.. link:/docs/ref/feature/#logstashCollector-1.0.html[Configure the Logstash collector feature] in the `server.xml` file.

.. Enable HTTP access logging.

. Start Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. See link:https://www.elastic.co/[the Elastic website] for instructions.

. Start the Open Liberty server and generate some events.

. Open Kibana in a browser and create an index.

- For Kibana 7, 6, or 5.6, click **Management** > **Index Patterns**.
** Enter `logstash-*` as the **Index Pattern**.
** Click **Advanced Options** and enter `logstash-*` as the **Index Pattern ID**.
** Select `datetime` as the **Time filter field name**, and click **Create**.

- For Kibana 5.0 - 5.5, click **Management** > **Index Patterns** and select `datetime` as the **Time filter field name**. Click **Create**.

- For Kibana 4, click **Settings** > **Index Patterns**, and select `datetime` as the **Time filter field name**. Click **Create**.

. Download a sample dashboard from the directory that corresponds to your version of Elastic  in the link:https://github.com/WASdev/sample.logstash.collector[Sample Logstash Collector dashboards for Liberty] repository.

. Import the dashboard into Kibana.

- For Kibana 7, 6, or 5, click **Management** > **Saved Object** > **Import**.
- For Kibana 4, click **Settings** > **Objects** > **Import**.

. View the dashboard.

- For Kibana 7, 6, or 5, click **Dashboard** > **Open** and then select the dashboard.
- For Kibana 4, click **Dashboard** > **Load Saved Dashboard** and then select the dashboard.

== Results

You configured your Open Liberty servers to send events to your Logstash server and can now view your events in the Liberty dashboard by using Kibana.
